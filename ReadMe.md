# JS Software Developer Assignment from Quasdev

We need to generate a table that contains data from two arrays of objects.

One array contains users and the second one contains messages. The messages are associated to each user via the "id" key of the objects.

In this file you will find two classes that automatically generate these objects in the required format.

Please generate a random number of users and some messages associated to each user using the helper classes included or any other metod you choose. Only the format of the objects needs to remain the same.


Table row onclick functionality:
    Display an usercard with all the data of the message and associated user.

You can modify this code as you see fit.
You can add any other css or javascript library, framework etc.
Please send the end result in .html format.
